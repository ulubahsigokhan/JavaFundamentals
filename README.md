# Java Fundamentals

A beginner-friendly Java fundamentals project designed to build a **strong, practical foundation** in core Java concepts. This repository is structured for learning, experimenting, and gradually improving clean coding habits.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand **core Java syntax and concepts**
* Practice writing **clean, readable, and maintainable code**
* Learn how to structure a Java project
* Build confidence before moving into advanced Java topics

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production application.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This project focuses on Java fundamentals, including:

* Variables and Data Types
* Operators

  * Arithmetic
  * Comparison
  * Logical
* Control Flow

  * `if / else`
  * `switch`
  * Ternary operator
* Methods

  * Method creation
  * Parameters and return values
  * Method reuse
* Basic program structure
* Code refactoring and cleanup

Each topic is written with **clarity over cleverness** so concepts are easy to understand.

```

* Each class focuses on **one concept only**
* Code is intentionally simple and readable
* Examples are separated to avoid confusion

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

3. Navigate to the `src` folder

4. Run any class containing a `main` method

## 🧹 Code Style Philosophy

This project follows these principles:

* Clear naming over short naming
* One responsibility per method
* Readability first
* Refactor whenever the code becomes unclear

Comments are used **only when they add value**, not to explain obvious code.

---

## 📚 Who This Is For

This repository is ideal for:

* Java beginners
* Students learning programming fundamentals
* Developers revisiting Java basics
* Anyone who wants clean, understandable examples

No prior Java experience is required.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned or possible additions:

* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Arrays and collections
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Basic unit testing
* Small practice exercises

---

## 📝 Notes

This repository is a **learning journal** as much as it is a codebase. Mistakes, refactors, and improvements are part of the process.

If you are learning Java: move slowly, run the code often, and focus on understanding *why* things work.
